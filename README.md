My talk about postmortems stands on the shoulders of giants. I plan to extend this resources list over time.

This talk was presented on 22.June.2019 at WordCamp Europe. It focuses on how postmortems can help teams improve their products, processes, and boost productivity of employees by embracing a blameless culture throughout an organization.
